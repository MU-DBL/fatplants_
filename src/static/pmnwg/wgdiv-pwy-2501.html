<div class="summaryText">Although β-oxidation is the major route for fatty acid degradation, fatty acids can also be subject to α- and ω-oxidation.<p class="ecocomment">There are several forms of α-oxidation. In this pathway a fatty acid is oxidized at the α-position (C-2) to give rise to a 2-hydroperoxy fatty acid. A different type of α-oxidation, used for the degradation of β-methyl-branched fatty acids, is described at <a href="https://metacyc.org/pathway?orgid=META&amp;id=PWY66-387" class="PATHWAY" data-tippy-content="<b>Pathway</b>: 3-methyl-branched fatty acid α-oxidation<br><b>ID</b>: PWY66-387<br><b>Synonyms:</b> β-methyl-branched fatty acid α-oxidation" aria-expanded="false">3-methyl-branched fatty acid α-oxidation</a>.</p><p class="ecocomment">2-hydroperoxy fatty acids are chemically unstable and are quickly converted to chain-shortened (by one carbon) fatty aldehydes through decarboxylation, or to 2-hydroxy fatty acids. The chain-shortened fatty aldehydes are further oxidized to free fatty acids which can enter the next round of α-oxidation. The conversion of the intermediate 2(R)-hydroperoxy fatty acids to 2(R)-hydroxy fatty acids may be spontaneous or catalyzed by a peroxidase [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12432929" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" Hamberg M, Ponce de Leon I, Sanz A, Castresana C (2002). <strong>&quot;Fatty acid alpha-dioxygenases.&quot;</strong> Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 68-69;363-74. PMID: 12432929" aria-expanded="false">Hamberg02</a>]. </p><p class="ecocomment">It was reported that pea α-dioxygenase catalyzes both the dioxygenation and the peroxidation activities [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10938370" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" Saffert A, Hartmann-Schreier J, Schon A, Schreier P (2000). <strong>&quot;A dual function alpha-dioxygenase-peroxidase and NAD(+) oxidoreductase active enzyme from germinating pea rationalizing alpha-oxidation of fatty acids in plants.&quot;</strong> Plant Physiol 123(4);1545-52. PMID: 10938370" aria-expanded="false">Saffert00</a>]. The conversion of the chain-shortened aldehydes to corresponding fatty acids may be spontaneous or catalyzed by an NAD+ oxidoreductase. An enzyme with such activity, described as "a 50 kDa subunit of α-dioxygenase" was described from pea [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10938370" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" Saffert A, Hartmann-Schreier J, Schon A, Schreier P (2000). <strong>&quot;A dual function alpha-dioxygenase-peroxidase and NAD(+) oxidoreductase active enzyme from germinating pea rationalizing alpha-oxidation of fatty acids in plants.&quot;</strong> Plant Physiol 123(4);1545-52. PMID: 10938370" aria-expanded="false">Saffert00</a>].</p><p class="ecocomment">Both polysaturated and unsaturated fatty acids are effective substrates in the pathway. Among the tested substrates are laurate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate, and arachidonate.</p><p class="ecocomment">The physiological role of fatty acid α-oxidation in plants is not clear, but the process has been correlated with responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, such as wounding and plant-pathogen interactions [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12060227" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" De Leon IP, Sanz A, Hamberg M, Castresana C (2002). <strong>&quot;Involvement of the Arabidopsis alpha-DOX1 fatty acid dioxygenase in protection against oxidative stress and cell death.&quot;</strong> Plant J 29(1);61-2.
