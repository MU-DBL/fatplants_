        Supporting evidence for this pathway in Aegilops tauschii: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways (UPP) that was generated for the COMET project, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. All UPP pathways are automatically imported into databases regardless of Pathologic predictions.

<b>Summary from MetaCyc:</b>
<br><br>
<div class="summaryText">Phospholipids are the major structural components of biological membranes. Some phospholipids  (i.e. phosphatidylinositol) also serve as important lipid-signaling molecules.  In plants, phospholipids  predominate extra-chloroplast membranes including the plasma membrane, mitochondria membrane,  endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomal membrane, with phosphatidylcholine and  phosphatidylethanolamine being the major constituents. On the other hand, glycolipids predominate  chloroplast envolope and thylakoid membranes. Phosphatidylglycerol is the only phospholipid found in  chloroplast thylakoids, and is critical for the structural and functional integrity of the thylakoid  membranes. <p class="ecocomment">Phospholipids are mostly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once synthesized,  they are transported to other phospholipid containing membranes. However, genetic and biochemical evidence has  demonstrated that phosphatidylglycerol can be synthesized in the plastids [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16774646" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" Xu C, Yu B, Cornish AJ, Froehlich JE, Benning C (2006). <strong>&quot;Phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis in chloroplasts of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in acyl-ACP glycerol-3- phosphate acyltransferase.&quot;</strong> Plant J 47(2);296-309. PMID: 16774646" aria-expanded="false">Xu06e</a>]. In addition,  mitochondria also contain enzymes for phospholipid synthesis, thus we cannot rule out the possibility  that phospholipids can be synthesized there. <br></p></div>
