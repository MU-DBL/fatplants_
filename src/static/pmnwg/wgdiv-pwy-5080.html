<div class="summaryText">A significant amount of the fatty acids synthesized in animals by the cytosolic enzyme complex fatty acid synthase (FAS) or taken up by the diet are further elongated into <a href="https://metacyc.org/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Very-long-chain-fatty-acids" class="COMPOUND" data-tippy-content="The term &quot;fatty acid&quot; was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=PROPIONATE&quot;>propanoate</a> and <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=BUTYRIC_ACID&quot;>butanoate</a> (but not the shorter <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=FORMATE&quot;>formate</a> and <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=ACET&quot;>acetate</a>).<br><br>The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.<br><br>Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Triacylglycerides&quot;>triglycerides</a>, <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Phospholipids&quot;>phospholipids</a>, <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Lipopolysaccharides&quot;>lipopolysaccharides</a>, and <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Cholesterol-esters&quot;>cholesterol esters</a>.<br><br>Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Fatty-Acyl-CoAs&quot;>fatty acyl-CoAs</a>, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length.

When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Saturated-Fatty-Acids&quot;>a saturated fatty acid</a>. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as <a href=&quot;/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids&quot;>an unsaturated fatty acid</a>.
