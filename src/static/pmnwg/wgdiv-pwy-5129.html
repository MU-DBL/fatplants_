<b>Summary from MetaCyc:</b>

<div class="summaryText"><b>General Background</b><p class="ecocomment">Sphingolipids are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cells. They are composed of a long-chain base (amino alcohol), an amide linked fatty acyl chain, and a polar head. The predominant long-chain bases in plants are C18 amino alcohols, with sphinganine, 4-hydroxysphinganine, and 4-hydroxy-8-sphingenine being the prevalent long-chain bases. The prevalent long-chain base of many mammalian sphingolipids, sphingosine (4-sphingenine), is found only in trace amounts in plants. The predominant fatty acyl chains in plants are alpha-hydroxy fatty acids, with saturated C22 to C26 hydroxy fatty acyl chains, especially 2-hydroxylignoceric acid, are the most common ones.</p><p class="ecocomment">Ceramide (without a polar head group), glucosylceramide, and derivatives of inositolphosphorylceramide are the predominant plant sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin, which has phosphocholine as the polar head group and is the major phosphosphingolipid in animals, has not been detected in plants. On the other hand, yeast contains exclusively inositolphosphorylceramides.</p><p class="ecocomment">Species- and tissue-specific diversity of the long-chain base and fatty acyl chain exists in plant glucosylceramides. In general, seed glucosylceramides are enriched with dihydroxy long-chain bases and C16 to C20 saturated hydroxy fatty acids. In contrast, leaves are enriched with trihydroxy long-chain bases and very long-chain (C20 to C26) saturated and monoenoic hydroxy fatty acids. Monoenoic hydroxyl fatty acids are predominantly found in glucosylceramides from cold hardy crops and Arabidopsis.</p><p class="ecocomment">It is estimated that sphingolipids account for up to 10% of total lipids in plants. Glucosylceramide is the major sphingolipid. It is a significant lipid component of the plant cell plasma and tonoplast. While our knowledge of sphingolipid functions are mainly learned from studies in mammals and yeast, plant sphingolipids are thought to serve as membrane structural components and signal molecules.</p><p class="ecocomment"> <b>About This Pathway</b></p><p class="ecocomment">Two mechanisms were shown for ceramide formation via condensation of a fatty acyl group with the amino group of a long chain base. One utilizes acyl-CoAs and is catalyzed by sphinganine N-acyltransferase, the other uses free fatty acids by ceramide synthase. The sphinganine N-acyltransferase route is most likely the major route in plants. The relative activity of sphinganine N-acyltransferase using acyl-CoA of varying chain length from 16 to 24 carbons parallel the distribution  of fatty acyl chains in glucosylceramides from different plant sources [<a href="https://metacyc.org/META/reference.html?type=CITATION-REFERENCE&amp;object=%5bLynch00%5d" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" Lynch, Daniel V (2000). <strong>&quot;Enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism in plants.&quot;</strong> Methods in enzymology, 311:130-149." aria-expanded="false">Lynch00</a>]. It suggests that sphinganine N-acyltransferase plays a key role in determining the respective acyl chain composition of naturally occurring plant glucosylceramides.</p><p class="ecocomment">Although hydroxylation of the long chain base can occur with free sphinganine, hydroxylation and desaturation of long chain bases, as well as alpha-hydroxylation of fatty acyl chains, occur primarily after the formation of ceramides.<br> </p><p class="ecoparagraph">
