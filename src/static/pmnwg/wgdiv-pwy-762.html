    <p class="ecocomment">
        Supporting evidence for this pathway in Aegilops tauschii: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways (UPP) that was generated for the COMET project, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. All UPP pathways are automatically imported into databases regardless of Pathologic predictions.

<b>Summary from MetaCyc:</b>
<br><br><div class="summaryText">Fatty acids constitute a major component of plant membranes in the form of glycerolipids, mainly phosphoglycerolipids and glycosylglycerolipids. The majority of them have C16 or C18 carbon chains and are attached to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. In Arabidopsis, the major fatty acids are C16:0, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3. Unsaturated fatty acids are significant to membrane functions such as photosynthesis and cold tolerance. C16:3 and C18:3 together make up more than 90% of the fatty acid content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a  major glycosylglycerolipid of leaf chloroplast membranes [<a href="https://metacyc.org/META/reference.html?type=CITATION-REFERENCE&amp;object=%5barabidopsis94%5d" class="CITATION-REFERENCE" data-tippy-content=" Elliot M.

The rest of the unsaturated fatty acids, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:2 and C18:3, on the other hand, are desaturated from C16:0 or C18:1 after C16:0 and C18:1 are incorporated into glycerolipids. These latter desaturation processes are catalyzed by membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases, and occur in chloroplasts and ER. Fatty acid desaturation is best studied in Arabidopsis using desaturase mutants. </p><p class="ecocomment">The desaturation of phosphatidylglycerol occurs in the chloroplast, and the desaturation of phosphatidylcholine occurs in the ER. Note that desaturation occurs on both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains, and that the order of the desaturation steps on one chain versus the other is not known. Here, all the possible steps are presented.<br> </p><p class="ecoparagraph">
