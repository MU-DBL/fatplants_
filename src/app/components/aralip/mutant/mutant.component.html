        <h2>Database of Arabidopsis Mutants of Acyl-Lipid Metabolism</h2><br>
    </header>
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>Information on over 280 Arabidopsis genes that have characterized mutants associated with Arabidopsis acyl lipid metabolism. The database is integrated within the ARALIP acyl lipid metabolism website.</li>
            <li>Information on the phenotypes of mutants, pathways and enzymes/proteins associated with the mutants and rapid access via hyperlinks to summaries, comments and to literature that provides information on the lipid composition of the mutants.</li>
            <li>Mutants for at least 30% of the genes in the database have multiple names, which have been compiled to reduce ambiguities in searches for information.</li>
            <li>Compilation in Excel of information on >280 mutants.

            <li>A list of 20 genes associated with acyl lipid metabolism that have NO T-DNA inserts reported in TAIR as of Nov, 2014.
