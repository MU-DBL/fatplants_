            <p>John B. Ohlrogge passed away surrounded by his family on February 12, 2025. He was a giant in the field of plant biochemistry and plant lipid metabolism and beloved by many of his colleagues and mentees. John received his BA in Chemistry from Earlham College in 1971, near his Indiana hometown before choosing to work with William E.M. Lands for his Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1975). There, John studied lipid biochemistry in <i>E. coli</i> and realized (<a href="https://aspb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Legacy-Society-Founding-Members-John-Ohlrogge.pdf">in his own words</a>) “Less research was being done on plants, which meant there were more opportunities to make new discoveries.” 
                As a result, he went on to study plant lipid metabolism with Paul Stumpf at UC Davis where he made the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.76.3.1194">fundamental discovery</a> that fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs in the chloroplast, not the cytosol, by subcellularly localizing acyl carrier protein.</p>
            <p>In 1980, John started his first “real” job as a Research Biochemist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Peoria, IL. In 1986, Chris R. Somerville, then a Professor at the MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory working on plant fatty acid metabolism, helped recruit John as a faculty member to Michigan State University (MSU), where he spent until his retirement in 2016. He was a member of the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology and later the Department of Plant Biology, rising through the ranks to become a University Distinguished Professor in 2003.

            At MSU, John trained many students and postdocs, who went on to distinguished careers on their own and now populate
            the ranks at international plant lipid meetings. One of his long-time collaborators was Mike Pollard, a postdoc
            colleague from the Stumpf lab, who after a successful career in the biotech industry, joined John’s laboratory. John
            had an inquisitive and sharp mind and approached problems as a classically trained biochemist in quantitative ways.
            He and Mike were thinking alike and perfectly complemented each other, resulting in many elegant contributions to
            the field. For example, they elucidated acyl fluxes through multiple pathways of <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/150/1/55/6107992?login=true">triacylglycerol synthesis</a> and
            their <a

                labeling of spinach leaves</a> tested existing and novel models of fatty acid transfer and lipid synthesis.
            John’s collaboration with Jörg Schwender and Yair Shachar-Hill led to the fundamental discovery of a <a
                href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03145">rubisco bypass</a> in developing Brassica embryos. John and
            his coworkers discovered key enzymes in essential aspects of plant lipid metabolism, for example in <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/19/1/351/6091539?login=true">suberin</a>
            and
            <a

            biosynthesis, as well as the synthesis of <a

            John never shied away from novel technological developments and regularly sought new collaborators, resulting in
            many discoveries and great friendships that continued throughout his life. For example, taking advantage of the MSU
            Research Technology Support Facility and their chip cDNA printer, he led the development of what was, at the time,
            the largest tissue-specific Arabidopsis cDNA expression chip to detect specific gene expression patterns related to
            oil biosynthesis in embryos in the <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/124/4/1582/6109890?login=true">wild type</a> and the <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/14/6/1191/6009758?login=true">wri1 mutant</a>. This work was done
            in collaboration
            with Christoph
            Benning, whom he helped recruit to MSU. John was convinced that while doing science is a privilege and mostly fun,
            it should ultimately contribute to improving people’s lives. One of his favorite quotations was from Thomas
            Jefferson “The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its culture.” John
            worked diligently to make this vision a reality during his lifetime. He was instrumental during the founding of the
            Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, and together with Christoph Benning, he explored ways to <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/25/2/677/6096659?login=true">enhance the
                energy density</a> of vegetative plant matter for biofuel and feed purposes. Both shared MSU’s Innovator of the
            Year award in
            2018 for these efforts. Together with Mike Pollard and their coworkers, John discovered an enzyme in <a
                href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1001707107?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">burning
                bush</a>
            responsible for the synthesis of acetyltriacylglycerol and introduced it into Camelina creating a <a
                href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pbi.12325">new crop plant</a>
            that produces a ready-touse biodiesel or low-calorie vegetable oil for human consumption. Thus, John achieved his
            dream of adding at least one more plant to the farmers’ repertoire in his lifetime.
        </p>

            John cared deeply about the scientific community and worked tirelessly to connect scientists around the world and
            support them in their shared goals. He initiated and organized national and international meetings and developed an
            important <a href="http://aralip.plantbiology.msu.edu/pathways/pathways">plant lipid database and resource</a>,
            something he continued working on past retirement. He never hesitated
            to share reagents and materials. wrote foundational reviews of <a
                href="https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/7/7/957/5985048?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false">plant
                lipid metabolism</a> that inspired generations of
            young scientists, and he organized the community together with Yonghua Li-Beisson to assemble the <a
                href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-arabidopsis-book/volume-2010/issue-8/tab.0133/Acyl-Lipid-Metabolism/10.1199/tab.0133.full">lipid
                chapter</a> of
            The Arabidopsis Book. John also served as Associate Editor of Plant Physiology for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
            John was never motivated by the thought of earning awards or medals for his innumerable accomplishments. However, he
            could not entirely escape them and for his lifetime achievements, John received the Martin Gibbs Award in 2009 from
            the American Society of Plant Biology (ASPB) and became a Fellow of ASPB. He was also a founding member of the <a
                href="https://aspb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Legacy-Society-Founding-Members-John-Ohlrogge.pdf">ASPB
                Legacy Society</a>. In 2000 he was awarded the Terry Galliard Medal at the International Symposium on Plant
            Lipids.

        <P>
            John loved talking about science and, at the same time, he cared deeply about the people around him. John’s door was
            always open, and he spent much of his time advising his mentees and colleagues, not just about their research, but
            also offered encouragement and support beyond science. With his kind, welcoming, and caring nature, John was a role
            model to all of us, cherished not only for his scientific insights and mentorship, but more so for showing us how to
            be a truly humanistic scientist. With Carol, his life partner at his side, they hosted many parties for his lab
            members and their families at their house and John famously organized an annual lab retreat at Wa Wa Sum, a rustic
            lodge camp in the North woods of Michigan on the banks of the Au Sable River. These retreats were filled with
            scientific discussions, canoeing, hiking, shared meals and drinks until late into the nights. But above all, his
            greatest love was reserved for his family, his partner Carol, their two sons, Michael and Aaron, their daughters in
            law, Audrey Johnson and Erika Malinoski, and their grandchildren George, Nicholas, Stanton, Terrell and Fredericka.
            John’s presence, wisdom and kindness will be deeply missed.
